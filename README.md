## 🌸 About the Project 
This project is a portfolio-style website built with:
- **Strapi** for content management (hosted on [Render](https://sbadmin-portal.onrender.com/admin) for videographer to easily update their portfolio)
- **Supabase** for database maintenance, ensuring data isn't lost when Render sleeps due to inactivity
- **Cloudinary** for thumbnail storage

⚠️ Since the Strapi API is hosted on Render (free version), the site may take **30–60 seconds** to load if the server is waking up from sleep.  

If you're in a rush and Render hasn't loaded the images, here’s a video walkthrough 👇
